# Sorting-algorithms-and-the-game-of-life, project completed November 2018
A university project about implementing 3 sorting algorithms and using these to simulate the game of life in C++. This achieved a mark of 85%.
Source.cpp contains most of the code implementing the heap, quick and bubble sort algorithms and also the simulation of the Game of Life
using vectors to store the coordinates of live cells. MVector.h contains class definitions defining vectors and a class for the game of
life. timing.h is NOT written by me, but was provided by the university as a means to time our sorting algorithms and use these timings to
discuss their time complexities. These discussions along with explanations of my implementation can be found in the report 
MATH49111....pdf.
